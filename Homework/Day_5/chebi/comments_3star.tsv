However, because of the symmetrical nature of the stercobilinogen molecule the direction of the skeletal numbering is reversed so that the earlier-cited substituents (the ethyl groups) may take the preferred lower locants 2,17.
198	36479	2006-09-11	64452	CompoundName	An equivalent name based on the skeletal numbering used for the stercobilin parent structure would be 3,18-diethyl-2,7,13,17-tetramethyl-1,19-dioxo-1,2,3,4,5,10,15,16,17,18,19,22,23,24-tetradecahydro-21H-biline-8,12-dipropanoic acid.

203	36973	2006-11-08	36973	General	Previously, descriptions such as graphite layers, carbon layers or carbon sheets have been used for the term graphene. Because graphite designates that modification of the chemical element carbon, in which planar sheets of carbon atoms, each atom bound to three neighbours in a honeycomb-like structure, are stacked in a three-dimensional regular order, it is not correct to use for a single layer a term which includes the term graphite, which would imply a three-dimensional structure. The term graphene should be used only when the reactions, structural relations or other properties of individual layers are discussed.
204	33418	2006-11-08	33418	General	The term graphite is also used often but incorrectly to describe graphite materials, i.e. materials consisting of graphitic carbon made from carbon materials by processing to temperatures greater than 2500 K, even though no perfect graphite structure is present.
205	36977	2006-11-09	36977	General	The use of the term graphite instead of the more exact term hexagonal graphite may be tolerated in view of the minor importance of rhombohedral graphite, the other allotropic form.
206	36978	2006-11-09	36978	General	The structure of rhombohedral graphite can be best considered as an extended stacking fault in hexagonal graphite. Rhombohedral graphite can not be isolated in pure form (natural graphite and laboratory preparations contain less than 40% of rhombohedral graphite in combination with hexagonal graphite). It is produced by shear deformation of hexagonal graphite and transforms progressively to the hexagonal (ABAB) modification on heating above 1600 K.

1233	65416	2012-11-13	65416	General	Aplysiallene was first isolated from the red alga Laurencia okamurai Yamada by Minoru Suzuki and Etsuro Kurosawa of Hokkaido University, Japan (Phytochemistry, 1985, v24(9), 1999-2002) who determined that the structure included a cis-fused 2,6-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton containing an (E,E)-bromodiene side-chain and an (R)-bromoallene substituent. The same compound was subsequently isolated from the Japanese sea hare, Aplysia kurodai and named 'aplysiallene' by M. Ojika et al. (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 2001, v65(2), 474-476) but was misidentified as having only one bromine atom in the molecule, while containing an extra methyl group instead. These errors was corrected in an erratum (M. Ojika et al., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 2003, v67(2), 460) where the identity of aplysiallene to the compound reported by Suzuki and Kurosawa was confirmed. Subsequently, an elegant total synthesis of aplysiallene by Jian Wang and Brian L. Pagenkopf at the University of Western Ontario (Org. Lett., 2007, v9(18), 3703-3706) resulted in a reassignment of the stereochemistry, affording the structure shown here.

1400	63038	2013-09-30	63038	General	Being an oxidising agent, ammonium nitrate (AN) is commonly mixed with fuel to make explosives. Under normal conditions, it is quite stable (i.e. it is an ingredient of many explosives, rather than an explosive itself). However, when heated (e.g. in a fire), AN can decompose, producing oxygen and a lot of heat. The heat produced causes more AN to decompose, generating more heat, and so on, while the oxygen produced causes the fire to burn more vigorously. The result is that once started, the thermal decomposition is generally impossible to stop and will often end in an explosion - see, for example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_Disaster

4664	88340	2015-11-02	88340	General	Product description from Merck-Millipore website (product 420116): A cell-permeable, biologically active peptide consisting of a carboxyl-terminal sequence derived from the JNK-binding domain (JBD) and an amino-terminal peptide containing the HIV-TAT48-57 sequence that imparts cell-permeability. Blocks the activation domain of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and prevents the activation of the transcription factor c-Jun (IC50 ~1 muM). Contains the minimal 20-amino acid inhibitory domain of islet-brain (IB), which is critical for interaction with JNK. The peptide is covalently linked to the 10-amino acid HIV-TAT48-57 sequence that acts as a carrier peptide and to two proline residue spacers. Inhibits IL-1beta-induced c-Jun and c-fos expression in insulin secreting betaTC-3 cells and offers protection against apoptosis. Does not affect insulin secretion and has no significant effect on the activities of ERK1, ERK2, or p38.
